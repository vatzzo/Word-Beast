# Word-Beast - Application Supporting Fast Reading. 
The project was made after I have seen a quite nice
position in the book shoop concering the art of fast reading
- Tom Buzan's "Speed Reading". There were a plenty of techniques
that could be applied to increase the process of reading.
The main one a "pointer method" was chosen and is the method
application is based on. To proceed with an animation I used
canvas to create an indicator in the form of a red rectangle that 
slides among a text. A user has to follow it with his or her eyes.
There are 3 path patterns that the indicator can follow. 
## Technologies
JS, HTML, SCSS, all graphics made in Inkscape
